# subwave-desktopTV

**A fork of [getsubwave/subwave-desktop](https://github.com/getsubwave/subwave-desktop)**
by the SUB/WAVE team — all the hard work (the Zig app, the Native SDK
integration, the whole player) is theirs. This fork only adds a "10-foot"
couch layer on top; upstream remains the place to go for the desktop player
itself, and their [releases](https://github.com/getsubwave/subwave-desktop/releases/latest)
still ship prebuilt macOS, Windows and Linux builds. MIT licensed, same as
upstream — see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

**What this fork is for:** running a self-hosted SUB/WAVE station on a living
room HTPC — specifically a [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg) box launched from
Steam Gaming Mode as a non-Steam shortcut, driven entirely from a game
controller mapped to keystrokes via Steam Input. That means no mouse, no
keyboard, and no pointer of any kind: every surface has to be reachable by
keyboard focus alone, from a couch, at TV viewing distance.

Upstream already ships most of the transport for this — space, arrows, `M`,
`L`, `Esc`, `1`–`5` and Tab traversal all work. The gap this fork closes is
keyboard reachability for the parts still built as pointer-only targets (most
notably the station switcher list). Changes here are kept narrow and
rebase-friendly so they can be offered back upstream.

It is still the same app underneath: declarative `.native` markup + Zig logic,
drawn by the SDK's own engine — no browser, no WebView — tracking the same
station HTTP API.

track metadata on the left, the booth feed of DJ picks, voice lines and played
tracks on the right, and the live FFT spectrum along the
bottom.](docs/images/player-booth.png)

## Features

- **Live stream** — plays the endless Icecast stream via `fx.playAudio` with
  tune-in/out, pause, volume, session mute, and 500 ms→60 s reconnect backoff.
  **Listener-selectable format:** MP3 is the universal floor; AAC / Opus / FLAC
  mounts appear in the back panel's SIGNAL row when the station advertises
  them *and* the platform can decode them (see Codecs below).
- **Update notice** — a daily GitHub Releases poll; a newer version lights a
  SERVICE row in the back panel (and a dot by the settings button) that opens
  the release page in the browser. No auto-install.
- **Now playing** — 5 s poll of `/api/now-playing` + `/api/state` +
  `/api/session`: title, artist, album, year, genre, BPM, key, moods, energy,
  LLM-token ticker, DJ, active show, listeners, elapsed, and the masthead
  context line (show · vibe · weather).
- **Cover art** — `fx.loadImage` pulls `/api/cover/:id` and decodes it off the
  loop thread into the stage's square record sleeve (initials placeholder while
  it loads), keeping a disk cache under the OS caches dir so a track that aired
  recently comes back without touching the network.
- **Real spectrum** — the SDK's FFT `.spectrum` feed (32 bands) rendered as an
  accent-themed bar analyzer with classic attack/decay ballistics.
- **Station themes** — 30 s poll of `/api/themes` repaints live via
  `DesignTokens`, with a per-listener theme override and light/dark schemes;
  the resolver (`color.zig`) converts hex / rgb() / **oklch()** /
  **color-mix(in oklab, …)** to real colors.
- **Onboarding** — first run (no saved station) is a station-address form with
  a four-step health check before tuning.
- **Station switcher** — Cmd/Ctrl+K sidebar: persisted recents (MRU, 8) plus
  the community directory (`getsubwave.com/stations.json`). A
  `SUBWAVE_STATION_URL` env var overrides the persisted station.
- **Section dial** — a segmented tab strip of five stops (keys 1–5) sharing one
  track, the active stop filled with the station accent: station guide (`/api/schedule`
  show list + 7×24 week grid with day tabs), timeline (up next + history), the
  bare LIVE stage, booth feed (all/DJ/tracks filter; the DJ's latest line
  tickers on the stage), and the request slip (`POST /api/request` with an
  optional signed name + status polling).
- **Signal + sleep** — timed `/api/health` probe → latency readout while
  playing; sleep timer (15–90 min) from the tray or the back panel.
- **Mini player** — a compact secondary window (420×168) toggled from the
  masthead button, the tray, or Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M. One player surface at a
  time: opening it minimizes the
  full player, and EXPAND — or closing the mini window — brings the full
  player back.
- **Menu-bar extra** — macOS `NSStatusItem` and the Windows tray (the GTK host
  still has none): live now-playing rows, tune in/out, mute, sleep cycle, open
  player, mini player, quit. On macOS and Windows the close button **hides** the
  main window — playback and the tray stay alive — via `app.zon`'s
  `close_policy`; on Linux it quits, because there is no tray to bring a hidden
  window back (see `docs/sdk-notes.md`).
- **Track notifications** — opt-in desktop toast when the song changes, via
  SDK 0.8.4's `fx.showNotification` (macOS, Windows and Linux). Background-only
  and on-air-only: no toast while the player is the app you are looking at,
  while tuned out, or on the first track after launch. Off by default; the
  switch is in the back panel under NOTIFICATIONS. Every toast reuses the
  `now-playing` id, so a new track **replaces** the previous notification
  instead of stacking, and carries an **Open Player** button that raises the
  window (SDK 0.9.1). This is the nearest thing to a Now Playing surface the
  SDK offers — there is still no MPRIS / MPNowPlayingInfoCenter / SMTC
  integration.
- **Keyboard transport** — space play/pause, ↑/↓ volume, M mute, L like the
  current track, Esc back to LIVE, Cmd/Ctrl+K stations, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M mini
  player, 1–5 dial stops (app-level fallback; never steals typing from the
  text fields).
- **Private stations** — when `/api/state` reports a privacy lock
  (`privatePlayer` / `listenerAuth`), a members-only gate replaces the player
  until the shared station password validates against `POST /api/station-auth`
  (fails closed); once accepted it persists in settings.json and rides the
  stream URL as `?auth=` for Icecast listener auth. Switching stations forgets
  it. Mirrors the web player's StationGate.
- **Settings persistence** — volume / theme override / stream format / station
  (+ name) / recents / notification opt-in survive restarts (`settings.json` in
  the OS per-app config dir), saved debounced + serialized via `fx.writeFile`.
- **Discord Rich Presence** — opt-in; shows the current track/artist (title
  clickable through to the station, cover art included) on your Discord
  profile while the SDK's `fx.spawn` drives a small self-relaunched helper
  (`--discord-rpc-helper`) that owns the local Discord IPC socket. Configure
  it from the Discord sheet by pasting your own application ID (see below) —
  no rebuild needed; `discord.zon` can bake in a build-time default.

## Layout

```
app.zon                 manifest (id, platforms {macos,linux}, window 980×660)
src/
  main.zig              App wiring: shell config, key fallback, tray, mini window
  model.zig             Model / Msg / boot / update (the reducer heart) + effects
  api.zig               endpoint URL builders (pure)
  json.zig              std.json typed decoders for each payload
  color.zig             hex/rgb/oklch/color-mix → canvas.Color (OKLab math) + tests
  theme.zig             7 station tokens → DesignTokens (tokens_fn)
  spectrum.zig          band ballistics (pure) + tests
  stream_format.zig     format ↔ mount table + platform decode gate + tests
  views.zig             view registry; composes the markup fragments
  views/*.native        onboarding, mini, player-top/-sidebar/-stage/-panel/-deck/-sheets
  icons/*.svg           app icons, registered at boot as icon="app:<name>"
  tests.zig             view build/layout contract + the pure modules' unit tests
```

The player runs entirely through the SDK **effects channel** (`.update_fx`):
timers drive polling, `fx.fetch` does HTTP, results return as typed Msgs, and
`fx.playAudio`/`fx.loadImage` handle audio + cover art. Every player view is
markup — `views.zig` only composes the fragments, deciding which conditional
ones appear.

## Build & run

Requires **Zig 0.16.0** and `@native-sdk/cli` **0.10.1**
(`npm i -g @native-sdk/cli`) — **plus one local SDK patch**. After every SDK
install/upgrade:

```bash
./scripts/apply-sdk-patches.sh && native test
```

The remaining patch fixes fractional-HiDPI text rendering on Linux
([vercel-labs/native#156](https://github.com/vercel-labs/native/issues/156));
it is documented in `docs/sdk-notes.md`. Symptom of a missing patch: pixelated
text on a fractional-scale display. (0.6.0 absorbed the two older patches — the
comptime quota fix and close-button-hides-window.)

```bash
native build -Dtrace=off && ./zig-out/bin/subwave-desktop   # release build + run
native dev                                       # debug build, Zig hot-rebuild
native test                                      # unit tests + typed markup contract
native check                                     # validate markup + manifest
native package --target linux --output dist      # distributable (also: --target macos)
```

`-Dtrace=off` matters on every `native build`: the SDK's default trace mode
writes unbounded per-frame records that can stall the Windows message loop
behind an AV minifilter (issue #23) — see `docs/sdk-notes.md`.

Headless verification (CI / agents) via the built-in automation server:

```bash
native build -Dautomation=true -Dtrace=off
./zig-out/bin/subwave-desktop &
native automate wait && native automate screenshot main-canvas
```

### Discord Rich Presence setup (optional)

Discord Rich Presence needs an application client ID (a public identifier,
not a secret). Create one at
[discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
then paste its Application ID into the app: panel → INTEGRATIONS → Discord
Rich Presence → CLIENT ID. Saving a valid ID turns the presence on
immediately and persists in settings.json; the status line under the toggle
reports the outcome ("Connected", "Discord isn't running", "Discord rejected
the client ID").

A build can also bake in a default ID via `src/discord.zon` (a listener-entered
ID always wins over it):

```zig
.{
    .client_id = "your-application-id-here",
}
```

With neither a pasted ID nor a `discord.zon` one, the sheet still offers the
CLIENT ID field but the toggle stays hidden, and no Discord IPC connection is
ever attempted.

## Codecs & the format picker

The station always serves the `/stream.mp3` floor; operators can enable
**AAC / Opus / FLAC** mounts, advertised via the `stream` flags on
`/api/now-playing`. The picker lists every mount the host engine can decode and
lets you tune the ones the station also advertises (`stream_format.zig`):

| Codec over Icecast | macOS (AVPlayer) | Windows (Media Foundation) | Linux (GStreamer `playbin`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| MP3 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| AAC (ADTS) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ where `gst-plugins-bad`/`libav` present |
| Ogg Opus | ❌ AVFoundation has no Ogg demuxer | ❌ no Ogg demuxer | ✅ offered optimistically |
| FLAC | ❌ no endless-stream FLAC | ❌ no endless-stream FLAC | ✅ offered optimistically |

Linux offers the Ogg mounts optimistically (decode support = installed
plugins); a non-MP3 pick that keeps failing drops back to the MP3 floor after
three reconnect attempts. macOS and Windows gates are exact, so failures there
stay network-shaped and never cost the listener their stored pick.

Windows was absent from this table until 0.2.0 and fell through to an MP3-only
default, so its builds shipped with no AAC and a hidden format picker. Nothing
caught it because cross-compiling the Windows binary never ran the test suite
for the target; building on a Windows runner did, immediately.

The picker itself lives on the transport deck: the SIGNAL row's chip reads the
live format and bitrate (`♪ MP3 192k`) and opens the sheet in one press. The
sheet names every mount this platform can decode, so mounts the station doesn't
serve are listed saying exactly that rather than quietly absent. The same row
is also in the back panel under SIGNAL.

**Playing through a different output device.** Not offered in-app: the SDK's
audio surface (re-checked at 0.10.1) is load/play/pause/stop/seek/volume, with
no device enumeration or output-device property on any host, so there is
nothing honest to build a picker on. Route it at the OS instead —
`pavucontrol` or any PipeWire patchbay on Linux, Settings → System → Sound →
Volume mixer on Windows. macOS has no per-app routing without a third-party
virtual audio driver. The API request is written up in
[`docs/sdk-audio-device-request.md`](docs/sdk-audio-device-request.md).

**OS media integration.** The SDK (re-checked at 0.10.1) has no system
now-playing or media-key surface — no `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`/
`MPRemoteCommandCenter` on macOS, no MPRIS on Linux — so hardware play/pause
keys and the OS Now Playing widget can't be wired up yet (SDK feature request).
What IS wired up: the menu-bar status item (macOS and Windows; the GTK host has
no tray, so Linux gets neither the extra nor close-to-hide), the in-window keyboard
transport, the opt-in background track notification (0.8.4's
`fx.showNotification`, made replaceable and given an Open Player button by
0.9.1 — the closest thing to a Now Playing surface available, though its one
action only raises the window, so nothing can control playback back), and
per-track
fetch of the station's own metadata (the app polls `/api/now-playing` rather
than relying on ICY in-stream metadata).

## Notes & gotchas

- **Audio playback works on Linux** (GTK + GStreamer) in this SDK build, despite
  the docs marking GTK/Win32 audio as unsupported. macOS uses AVFoundation
  (one `AVPlayer` + `MTAudioProcessingTap` for the spectrum feed).
- `model.zig` `boot_volume` defaults to **0.8**; the persisted volume from
  `settings.json` wins after first run. Decode/position/spectrum report even
  at volume 0.
- **Gotcha:** a `/` in the *scene* window title crashes GTK at `app_start`; keep
  the branded slash out of `app.zon`/`shell_windows` titles (it's fine in
  `runWithOptions.window_title`).
- The SDK can't resize a live window — that's why the mini player is its own
  model-declared window rather than a main-window reshape.
- The FFT spectrum feed only emits while a window is actually visible on the
  glass (SDK occlusion gate) — a flat analyzer from an app launched in the
  background is not a bug; activate the app first.

## Shipping checklist

All four artifacts are built by CI. Publishing a GitHub release fires
`release: published`, and one workflow per platform builds, verifies and
uploads its asset onto that release (the macOS workflow is a two-leg matrix,
one per CPU flavor):

| Workflow | Runner | Asset | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `release-macos.yml` | `macos-15` | `.dmg` | Apple Silicon; ad-hoc signed, so first launch needs right-click → Open |
| `release-macos.yml` | `macos-15-intel` | `-intel.dmg` | Intel (x86_64), built and tested natively; label supported until Aug 2027 |
| `release-windows.yml` | `windows-latest` | `-windows-x64.zip` | built and launched on real Windows |
| `release-linux.yml` | `ubuntu-24.04` | `-linux-x64.tar.gz` | needs glibc 2.39+ and GTK4 |

Each one applies the local SDK patch before building
(`scripts/apply-sdk-patches.sh`), so a release cannot ship without it, and
each refuses to run if the tag disagrees with `.version` in `app.zon`. The
macOS and Windows legs additionally run `scripts/set-close-policy.sh hide`
before testing, which is how those builds get the menu-bar close semantics that
`app.zon` cannot declare for all three targets at once. Shared
toolchain setup and the Zig/SDK version pins live in
`.github/actions/setup-native`.

Every release build passes `-Dcpu=baseline`, and that flag is load bearing: a
plain `native build` bakes the CI runner's CPU features into the binary, which
is how v0.2.1's Windows exe shipped requiring AVX-512 and silently failed to
start on most machines. `scripts/audit-cpu-baseline.sh` disassembles each
shipped x86-64 artifact in CI and fails the leg if the pin ever regresses.

Two runner pins are deliberate. `ubuntu-24.04` because Linux can't be
cross-compiled (the binary links the GTK4 system stack, 113 shared libraries,
nothing bundled) and because ubuntu-22.04's GTK 4.6 would compile the
fractional-HiDPI fix out — it's gated on GTK 4.12+ — and quietly ship
pixelated text. `windows-latest` because building there means the app is
actually launched on Windows under `-Dautomation=true` rather than
cross-compiled and hoped for.

`./scripts/make-release.sh` is the way to cut one. It builds nothing itself:
it checks that main is clean, in sync, on an unused tag and **already green in
CI on that exact commit**, then creates the release and follows the three runs
until every asset is attached (four in all — the macOS run uploads two DMGs).
Since nothing is built locally, a release can be cut from any machine.

Every push to main and every pull request also runs `native check`, `native
test` and `native build` on every release platform, both macOS CPU flavors
included (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
Platform-specific code can only be tested where it runs — a decode-gate bug
shipped from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 because Windows was only ever cross-compiled, and
cross-compiling never runs the target's suite.

Linux reach: Ubuntu 24.04+, Fedora 40+, Arch. **Not** Ubuntu 22.04 or
Debian 12 (glibc 2.35/2.36) — those build from source.

Not yet done for release: signing macOS with a real Developer ID and
notarizing, auto-update (out of scope v1), and crash reporting beyond the
SDK's panic capture.

Design + plan live under `docs/`.

## License

MIT, see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Use it, fork it, ship your own build of it; just
keep the copyright notice.

Two things that license does not cover, because they are not this repo's to
give. The Native SDK the app is built on is Apache 2.0 and belongs to Vercel.
And whatever music a station plays through this player is the station
operator's to have licensed: the player is a client, it ships no audio.
